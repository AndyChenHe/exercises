# Exercise 3
In this exercise, you'll practice using the `ggplot2` library to create map visualizations. Specifically, you will be creating a map of voting results for the infamous 2016 presidential election (data compiled by [Tony McGovern](https://github.com/tonmcg/County_Level_Election_Results_12-16)).

To complete the exercise, open the `exercise-3/exercise.R` file in RStudio, and follow the instructions there.
